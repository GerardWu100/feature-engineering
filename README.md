# Simple Feature Engineering

This project builds categorized stock features from OHLCV market data.

OHLCV means **open**, **high**, **low**, **close**, and **volume**. The workflow is intentionally small:

```text
load data -> clean invalid rows -> compute categorized features -> export files
```

## What It Does

- Loads stock OHLCV data from ClickHouse or a local CSV file.
- Validates the run config before loading data, so bad feature names, category
  filters, output formats, and impossible windows fail with clear messages.
- Cleans impossible market-data rows.
- Computes features by category:
  - `returns`: price change features (log and simple returns).
  - `trend`: direction and momentum (moving average, price vs SMA, rate of change, RSI, MACD line/signal/histogram).
  - `volatility`: price movement size and instability (rolling return std, bar range, ATR).
  - `volume`: trading activity (relative volume, dollar volume, volume change, VWAP, price vs VWAP).
  - `target`: forward-looking labels for supervised learning (`next_n_bar_return`).
- Exports feature data to Parquet and/or CSV.
- Writes a small `feature_catalog.csv` with feature names, categories, formulas, and descriptions.

## Install

```bash
uv sync
```

## Run

Database run:

```bash
uv run python run.py --config config.toml
```

Installed script:

```bash
uv run feature-pipeline --config config.toml
```

For ClickHouse, create `.env` in the project root:

```bash
CLICKHOUSE_HOST=127.0.0.1
CLICKHOUSE_PORT=50050
CLICKHOUSE_USER=your_user
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=your_password
CLICKHOUSE_SECURE=false
CLICKHOUSE_VERIFY=false
```

For a local CSV run, set this in `config.toml`:

```toml
[run]
source = "csv"
input_path = "data/raw/prices.csv"
```

The CSV must include:

```text
symbol,ts,open,high,low,close,volume
```

## Adding A Feature

1. Put the function in the matching category file under `src/feature_engineering/features/`.
2. Decorate it with `@register(...)`.
3. Add a `[[features.params]]` entry in `config.toml`.
4. For live use, add an O(1) accumulator in `engine/online.py` and register it in
   `ONLINE_FEATURE_FACTORIES`. The equivalence test then checks it against the
   batch version.

Example:

```toml
[[features.params]]
name = "ma_20"
fn = "moving_average"
window = 20
enabled = true
```

## Category Filters

Use category filters to run grouped feature sets without editing Python:

```toml
[features]
include_categories = ["returns", "trend"]
exclude_categories = ["target"]
```

An empty `include_categories` list allows all enabled features. `exclude_categories` removes matching categories after the include rule.

## Intraday Session Reset

Rolling features use row-count windows. On intraday bars a window can otherwise
reach back across the overnight gap (a 20-bar average at 09:30 would include the
previous day's last bars). Enable a per-day reset so windows and forward targets
never cross day boundaries:

```toml
[features]
reset_by_session = true
```

Leave it `false` (the default) for daily bars, where one row already is one day.
This relies on `ts` being in the exchange's local time (see Data Contract below).

## Data Contract

The loader assumes:

- Prices are split- and dividend-adjusted. The pipeline does not adjust for
  corporate actions, so unadjusted prices would turn a split into a fake return.
- `ts` is in the exchange's local wall-clock time (US equities: US/Eastern). The
  ClickHouse session filter and the intraday reset both rely on this.

## Use As A Module

The stages are importable for in-memory use inside research or trading code, with
no file I/O:

```python
from feature_engineering import clean_ohlcv, compute_features

cleaned, report = clean_ohlcv(raw_ohlcv_frame)
features = compute_features(cleaned, config_dict)
```

`config_dict` is the same plain dict shape that `config.toml` parses into.

For repeated use there are two engines that run the registered features without
re-walking the config each call:

```python
from feature_engineering import FeatureEngine, OnlineFeatureEngine

# Research / backtest: resolve the config once, transform many frames.
engine = FeatureEngine(config_dict)
features = engine.transform(cleaned)

# Live trading: O(1) per bar. Feed one bar (dict or Series) at a time.
live = OnlineFeatureEngine(config_dict)        # rejects forward-looking targets
for bar in stream:                              # bar has symbol, ts, OHLCV keys
    values = live.update(bar)                   # -> {feature_name: value}
```

The online accumulators reproduce the batch feature math exactly; an equivalence
test in `tests/test_engines.py` enforces it. Forward-looking `target` features
cannot be served online, so train on batch output (with the target) and serve
live features without it.

## Config Validation

The pipeline validates `config.toml` before loading data. Important checks include:

- `run.source` is `csv` or `clickhouse`.
- `run.output_formats` contains only `csv` and/or `parquet`.
- ClickHouse runs include non-empty `symbols`, `start_date`, and `end_date`.
- Feature `fn` values exist in the registry.
- Enabled feature `name` values are unique output columns.
- Category filters use real categories and do not both include and exclude the same category.
- Positive integer parameters such as `window`, `periods`, and `bars` are at least 1.

## Outputs

Outputs are written to `output_dir` from `config.toml`, for example `outputs/stocks/`.

- `features_v{version}_{timestamp_with_microseconds}.parquet`
- `features_v{version}_{timestamp_with_microseconds}.csv`
- `feature_catalog.csv`
- `run_summary_v{version}_{timestamp}.json` - run timestamp, the full config
  snapshot, rows per symbol, and per-feature health (null counts and value
  ranges) for reproducibility and quick checks.

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```
